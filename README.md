# The Awesome System Swift Index

The Swift open source community is growing, but the cross-platform codebase is not huge yet. Help expand it by making something and adding it to the index :)

Our objective is to feature cross-platform libraries, designed for wherever Swift runs ;)

## How do I...

* **add to the Index?** Issue a Pull Request!

* **help?** Give us feedback about what you'd like to see here. Currently we're making a List, but it could be a table as well with important characteristics like (a) State of development and (b) Systems supported, on the colums of the grid.

## The Index

_Structure is WIP_

### Apps / Tools

#### Developer Tools
* [Archery](https://github.com/vknabel/Archery): A Swift framework and command-line tool to **manage** your projects' **metadata**. Runs on Darwin and Linux.
* [langserver-swift](https://github.com/RLovelett/langserver-swift): A Swift implementation of the open **Language Server Protocol**. Linux port on the [making](https://github.com/RLovelett/langserver-swift/pull/36).
* [Marathon](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon): A command-line tool to **run and manage** Swift scripts. Runs on Darwin and Linux.
* [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint): A Swift framework and command-line tool to **run and install** Swift Package Manager **command-line tools**. Runs on Darwin and Linux.
* [SourceKitten](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten): a Swift framework and command-line tool for interacting with **SourceKit**. Runs in Darwin and Linux ✨
* [SourceKittenDaemon](https://github.com/terhechte/SourceKittenDaemon): **Swift auto-completions** for any text editor. Linux port in progress.
* [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery): a command-line tool for **metaprogramming** for Swift. Runs on Darwin. Linux support is [planned](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/milestone/2).
* [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint): a command-line tool to **lint** your Swift code. Runs on Darwin and Linux.
* [Swift Development Environment](https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment): a vscode plugin for Swift including **autocompletion**. Supports Linux and Darwin.

### Libraries

#### Quality of Life libraries
* [CLSwift](https://github.com/twof/CLSwift): Framework for **writing command-line tools** in Swift. Includes type safe argument parsing, input validation, and generated help messages.
* [Commandant](https://github.com/Carthage/Commandant): a framework for **parsing** command-line **arguments**.
* [Commander](https://github.com/kylef/Commander): a framework for **parsing** command-line **arguments**.
* [Vapor-Console](https://github.com/vapor/console): provides APIs for performing **console I/O**, including outputting stylized text, requesting user input, and displaying activity indicators like loading bars.
* [Stencil](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil): a **templating** engine inspired by Django and Mustache.
* [SwiftCheck](https://github.com/typelift/SwiftCheck): a powerful library for **Property Testing**. Inspired by Haskell's QuickCheck.

#### System libraries
* [iNotify](https://github.com/Ponyboy47/inotify): _Linux only_ a Swift wrapper around the CInotify library. The objective is to be able to have File Events akin to those you can subscribe to in Darwin. _WIP_

#### Web libraries
* [Embassy](https://github.com/envoy/Embassy): a lightweight async HTTP server library.
* [Tris](https://github.com/tris-foundation/universe): a swift toolbox (async, io, crypto and more) with web server built on top. _WIP_
* [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor): a server-side Swift web framework.

#### Compute libraries
* [Nifty](https://github.com/nifty-swift/Nifty): a `numPy`-like library for Swift. Wraps `LAPACK` and `Accelerate` for performance. Currently on alpha.

#### Cipher / Security
* [CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift): Crypto related functions and helpers for Swift, implemented in Swift.

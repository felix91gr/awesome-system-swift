# The Awesome System Swift Index

The Swift open source community is growing, but the cross-platform codebase is not huge yet. Help expand it by making something and adding it to the index :)

Our objective is to feature cross-platform libraries, designed for wherever Swift runs ;)

## How do I...

* **add to the Index?** Issue a Pull Request!

* **help?** Give us feedback about what you'd like to see here. Currently we're making a List, but it could be a table as well with important characteristics like (a) State of development and (b) Systems supported, on the colums of the grid.

## The Index

_Structure is WIP_

### Apps / Tools

#### Developer Tools
* [SourceKittenDaemon](https://github.com/terhechte/SourceKittenDaemon): Swift auto-completions for any text editor. Linux port in progress.
* [langserver-swift](https://github.com/RLovelett/langserver-swift): A Swift implementation of the open Language Server Protocol. Linux port on the making.
* [SourceKitten](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten): a Swift framework and command-line tool for interacting with SourceKit. Runs in Darwin and Linux âœ¨ 

#### Command-line Utilities

### Libraries

#### Quality of Life libraries
* [Commandant](https://github.com/Carthage/Commandant): a framework for parsing command-line arguments.
* [SwiftCheck](https://github.com/typelift/SwiftCheck): a powerful library for Property Testing. Inspired by Haskell's QuickCheck.

#### System libraries
* [iNotify](https://github.com/Ponyboy47/inotify): _Linux only_ a Swift wrapper around the CInotify library. The objective is to be able to have File Events akin to those you can subscribe to in Darwin. _WIP_

#### Web libraries
* [Embassy](https://github.com/envoy/Embassy): a lightweight async HTTP server library.
* [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor): a server-side Swift web framework.

#### Compute libraries
* [Nifty](https://github.com/nifty-swift/Nifty): a `numPy`-like library for Swift. Wraps `LAPACK` and `Accelerate` for performance. Currently on alpha.

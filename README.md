# The Awesome System Swift Index

## How to add to the index

Issue a Pull Request :)

## How to help

Give us feedback about what you'd like to see here. Currently I think I'll make a List, but it could be a table as well with important characteristics like (a) State of development and (b) Systems supported, on the colums of the grid.
